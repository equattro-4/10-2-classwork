Summary: This is a base coding model for love and how it works, but there are many other events and factors that can effect the properties of love, this is an incomplete draft and it would take much more long and thoughtful work to come up with a near complete model, but I dont think its possible to create a perfect coding model for love, because evertxy person is different and shares love with their partner in nuanced ways.
